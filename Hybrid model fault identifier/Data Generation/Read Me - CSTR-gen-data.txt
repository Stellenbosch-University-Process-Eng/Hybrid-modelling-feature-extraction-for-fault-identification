The CSTR_gen_data_UA.mat file represents a dataset generated using the CSTR model with the UA error fault case being actived.
The variables contained within the file represent process measurements recorded during the the simulation. 
Each column in the variable matrix represents the values of the variable for a specific process fault magnitude and each row represents an observation at a specific time instance. The time intervl between observations is one minute.
The variables are labelled in the following fashion:

For a variable labelled Ca_sens_UA the Ca_sens refers to the variable name(in this case the sensor reading of the outlet concentration) and _UA refers to the fault case( in this case the heat transfer coefficient error).

The fault cases are labelled as follows: 
nrm - normal case
UA- overall heat transfer coefficient fault
fin - catalyst deactivation fault
serr - Inlet concentration fault

The variable names are as follows:
Ca_in - inlet concentration
Ca_out - outlet concentration
Ca_sens - senor reading of outlet concentration
F_crt - inlet flow rate once control action is applied
k - reaction rate 
T_in - inlet temperature 
T_out - outlet temperature
Tj_sens - jacket temperature
